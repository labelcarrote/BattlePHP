===== Main principles 
[**Sawhat**](https://github.com/labelcarrote/BattlePHP) is a card based wiki.  
As it is a wiki, you can edit everything the way you like for everyone but unlike other *classic* wiki, the card based interface means there's no hierarchical link between cards. It's more like you'd have a gigantic post-it (R) wall with a search functionality.



===== Basic usage
==== Creating a card
Cards can be accessed by typing their name in the url. If you type an url that is not already used as a card name, Sawhat will show you an empty card with an *Edit* link to create it.

Since it's url encoded, you can only use *Latin characters* (from *a* to *z* and from *A* to *Z*) and *Arabic numerals* (from *0* to *9*).  
You can use underscores `_` or hyphens `-` to add spaces.  
Double underscore will create a colon followed by a space `: ` and a double hyphen will result in a single one `-`.

&gt; typing `test__insert-a-B--card_-_like_a_boss`  
&gt; will create a card named `test: insert a B-card - like a boss`

Once your card name is chosen, you can create its content. Keep reading to know how.

==== Editing a card
Once you're in the card edit page you'll find the card parameters first.  
The color will be used to display the card header and card links. Just click the input to access the color picker or type a color in an hexadecimal form.  
*&quot;Is Private ?&quot;* checkbox is used to make the card private, assuming you know the password to access it ... which you don't ...

Next is the text zone where you will write the card content.  
There's a few rules to format text based on Markdown syntax, read more about it in the [*Syntax*](#Syntax) section below.  
Click the *Save* button or simply hit *Ctrl+S* anytime to save your card.

You can upload and attach files to a card by using the *Files* section in the *Edit* page.

Finally there's a quick history of your card at the bottom of the page allowing you to go back to a previous version.

==== Searching a card
A search is available at the bottom of any page.  
Search is restricted to *one* word and in card name only for now.  
Add an hyphen `-` to your queried word in the search-box to search for cards *not* containing the word.



===== [#]Syntax
Syntax is based on [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) with some adjustments.
